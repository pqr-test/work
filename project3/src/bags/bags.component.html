        Interesting question, but like many interesting questions,
        this one also does not have a clear answer.
        Bags are such a craze for some that they are even 
        willing to pay more than what it would cost for a car for
        owning some of those designer bags.
        And for the majority of us, a Bag is one accessory we cannot do without.
